# Extract Text

Extract text from files to make them searchable and machine readable.

Once installed and active, this module has the following features:

- The module adds an "extracted text" property where it sets extracted text to
  media and items.
- When adding a media, the module will automatically extract text from the file
  and set the text to the media.
- When adding or editing an item, the module will automatically aggregate the
  media text (in order) and set the text to the item.
- When editing an item or batch editing items, the user can choose to refresh or
  clear the extracted text.
- When editing a media, the user can choose to refresh or clear the extracted
  text.
- The user can view the module configuration page a) to see which extractors are
  available on their system and b) to disable individual extractors.

## Supported file formats:

- DOC (application/msword)
- DOCX (application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document)
- HTML (text/html)
- ODT (application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text)
- PDF (application/pdf)
- RTF (application/rtf)
- TXT (text/plain)

Images files are supported by tesseract if compiled with the [required libraries](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/InputFormats.html):

- BMP (image/bmp)
- GIF (image/gif)
- JP2 (image/jp2)
- JPG (image/jpeg)
- PNG (image/png)
- TIFF (image/tiff)
- WEBP (image/webp)

Note that some file extensions or media types may be disallowed in your global
settings.

## Extractors:

### catdoc

Used to extract text from DOC and RTF files. Requires [catdoc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/catdoc).

### docx2txt

Used to extract text from DOCX files. Requires [docx2txt](http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/).

### filegetcontents

Used to extract text from TXT files. No requirements.

### lynx

Used to extract text from HTML files. Requires [lynx](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lynx).

### odt2txt

Used to extract text from ODT files. Requires [odt2txt](https://linux.die.net/man/1/odt2txt).

### pdftotext

Used to extract text from PDF files. Requires [pdftotext](https://linux.die.net/man/1/pdftotext),
a part of the poppler-utils package.

### tesseract

Used to extract text from image files (OCR). Requires [tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Command-Line-Usage.html).

## Configuring extractors

Some extractors allow you to configure how they extract text. You can configure
them using the "extract_text/options" config in your local configuration file
(config/local.config.php). For example, if you want to always skip the first page
of PDFs, add the following:

```php
'extract_text' => [
    'options' => [
        'pdftotext' => [
            'f' => 2,
        ],
    ],
],
```

Another example: if you want to use English and German together for OCR, add the
following:

```php
'extract_text' => [
    'options' => [
        'tesseract' => [
            'l' => 'eng+deu',
        ],
    ],
],
```

The following extractors have configuration options:

### filegetcontents

- offset: The offset where the reading starts (default 0)
- maxlen: Maximum length of data read (default null)

### pdftotext

- f: First page to convert (default null)
- l: Last page to convert (default null)

### tesseract

- l: Language/script (default 'eng')
- psm: Page segmentation mode (default 3)
- oem: OCR Engine mode (default 3)

See the [tesseract manual](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/doc/tesseract.1.asc) for more info.

## Disabling text extraction

You can disable text extraction for individual extractors in the module config
page.

You can disable text extraction for a specific media type by setting the media
type alias to `null` in the "extract_text_extractors" service config in your
local configuration file (config/local.config.php). For example, if you want to
disable extraction for TXT (text/plain) files, add the following:

```php
'extract_text_extractors' => [
    'aliases' => [
        'text/plain' => null,
    ],
],
```

## Long-running extraction

Extractors may take a long time to process. Running them in the browser could result
in long wait times and server/brower timeouts, especially if done in synchronous
batches. For processes that take too long, users have two options to extract text:

- In the item edit page, by selecting "Refresh text (background)".
- In the item browse page, by selecting the "Edit all" batch action.

Both of these options will run text extraction in a background job.

You can set an extractor to only run in the background using the "extract_text/
background_only" config in your local configuration file (config/local.config.php).
For example, if you want to set the pdftotext extractor as background only, add
the following:

```php
  'extract_text' => [
      'background_only' => [
          'pdftotext',
      ],
  ],
```

Note that extractors set as background only will not automatically extract text
when adding a media. You will need to extract text using the two options above.
